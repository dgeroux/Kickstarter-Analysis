# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to offer data-backed insights that will put my client, Louise, in a position to make informed business decisions. 
Louise funds her plays on crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter. She has provided me with data in hopes to answer a few simple questions to put herself in a better position to be successful with her campaigns. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I organized the data in a way that would highlight the different outcomes (successful, failed, canceled) of the Kickstarter campaigns based on their respective launch date. To make the analysis more relevant to Louise, I filtered out all other campaign cateogories leaving just the 'theater' cateogory. The purpose of this analysis was to determine if there were any advantages to starting a campaign during a certain time of year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I organized the data in a way that would highlight the different outcomes (successful, failed, canceled) of the Kickstarter campaigns based on their respective goals. To make the analysis more relevant to Louise, I filtered out all other campaign subcategories leaving just the 'plays' subcateogory. The purpose of this analysis was to determine if there were any advantages to setting a specific goal for a campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The one challenge I had was figuring out how to arrange the data within the pivot table to be able to generate a graph or chart that would easily visualize the findings. I was able to overcome this by really focusing on the logic and using other graphs and charts I've made as a reference.
## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  (1) In the 'theater' cateogory, campaigns started in May, June, and July are the most successful.
  (2) In the 'theater' cateogory, campaigns started in November and December are the least successful. 
### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  (1) In the 'plays' subcategory, generally speaking, campaigns with lower goals are more successful.
  (2) In the 'plays' subcategory, campaigns with goals less than $1,000 were the most successful (76%).
  (3) In the 'plays' subcategory, campaigns with goals between $45,000 and $49,999 were the least successful (0%).
  (4) In the 'plays' subcategory, campaigns with goals less than $5,000 were 73% successful and campaigns between $35,000 and $44,999 were 67% successful.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
I think the main limitation with this dataset is the limited sample size paired with limited variables and data points. With limited information, it's more difficult to determine correlation vs causation. 
### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
It would be interesting to create a graph that would show the difference in the outcomes based on the duration of the campaign.
It would also be interesting creating a grapgh that would determine if there was any correlation between number of backers and successful campaigns.
