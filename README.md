# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to offer data-backed insights that will put my client, Louise, in a position to make informed business decisions. 
Louise funds her plays on crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter. She has provided me with data in hopes to answer a few simple questions to put herself in a better position to be successful with her campaigns. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I organized the data in a way that would highlight the different outcomes (successful, failed, canceled) of the Kickstarter campaigns based on their respective launch date. To make the analysis more relevant to Louise, I filtered out all other campaign cateogories leaving just the 'theater' cateogory. The purpose of this analysis was to determine if there were any advantages to starting a campaign during a certain time of year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I organized the data in a way that would highlight the different outcomes (successful, failed, canceled) of the Kickstarter campaigns based on their respective goals. To make the analysis more relevant to Louise, I filtered out all other campaign subcateogories leaving just the 'plays' subvateogory. The purpose of this analysis was to determine if there were any advantages to setting a specific goal for a campaign.  
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
